This project provides the user with a set of options pertaining to the Vigenere Ciphering process. Depending on the selection made by the user, the program can either encrypt or decrypt a message made up of a string, or display the full Vigernere Table. This project is useful as it allows for a user to properly encrypt or decrypt a message using a shift value without the need to do any of the calculations or shifting of the letters manually.
